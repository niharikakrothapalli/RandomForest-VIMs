# RandomForest-VIMs

## INTRODUCTION
Random Forest is a state of the art machine learning method, but as such is also generally a black box in terms of how it makes its predictions. Hence, being able to determine how important each variable is to the model is extremely relevant, but also not an easy task. Over the years, many different Variable Importance Measures have arisen. This project focuses on creating a framework for random forest VIMs Importance Measures which can be applied to real life data.
